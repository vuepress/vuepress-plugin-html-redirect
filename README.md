## Feature

- Support virtual URLs as source URLs.
- Support `countdown`.
- Work with static `base` and [dynamic base](https://github.com/vuepressjs/vuepress-plugin-dynamic-base).

## Motivation

In the site development of vuepress, a small directory structure adjustment will invalidate some URLs, but these URLs may have been published. With this plugin, you can keep those disappeared URLs forever.

## Install

```bash
yarn add -D @vuepress/plugin-html-redirect
# OR npm install -D @vuepress/plugin-html-redirect
```

## Usage

- Write redirects:

The agreed file to write `redirects` config is `/path/to/.vuepress/redirects`, whose format is as follows:

```
[url] [redirect_url]
[url] [redirect_url]
[url] [redirect_url]
...
```

example:

```
/2020/03/27/webpack-5-module-federation/ /translations/2020/03/27/webpack-5-module-federation/
``` 

- Simple usage:

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    '@vuepress/html-redirect', // OR full name: '@vuepress/plugin-html-redirect'
  ],
}
```

- Disable `countdown`:


```js
// .vuepress/config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['@vuepress/html-redirect', {
      countdown: 0,
    }],
  ],
}
```

It means that the publc path will be different acccording to the NEV you set, and the router base will be `'/'` when the host is `hostA`, and `'/blog/'` when the host is `hostB`.

## Options

### countdown

- Type: `string`
- Description: Control how many seconds the page will be redirected, defaults to `3`.

### enableHistoryRedirect

- Type: `boolean`
- Description: Enable redirects when navigation is based on History API, defaults to `false`.

Single Page Applications (SPA) typically only utilise one index file that is accessible by web browsers: usually index.html. Navigation in the application is then commonly handled using JavaScript with the help of the [HTML5 History API](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#the-history-interface), in VuePress we leverage [vue-router](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/routing.html) under the hood.

## TODO

- Support directory redirects.
